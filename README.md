# AutoLabelTool

This tool is still in development.

From time to time there is need to create database of images for machine learning. In many occasions we need to generate
images by some kind of augumentator. Most problematic is to label images. This small tool is taking augumented images and
pasting them to some template backgournd and then create new image with xml(in Pascal VOC Format) for every image.
